### Abstract

In this talk, I will explore statistical advances in wildlife population monitoring, focussing on methods for estimating multispecies animal abundance. Traditional management approaches typically prioritise species of economic or ecological concern, leaving millions of others unmonitored. Yet, long-term monitoring is critical for understanding ecosystem dynamics, especially those influenced by climate change. In this context, I will firstly discuss a novel multispecies N-mixture modelling framework capable of estimating abundance and interspecies correlations for unmarked animal populations, while accounting for imperfect detection, zero-inflation, and serial autocorrelation. I will then introduce a novel framework, called the triple Poisson model, which can be used to estimate animal abundance using scarce data on animal vestiges (such as scats, fur and footprints). Although it does not incorporate spatial or temporal trends (and this is the object of future work), the framework offers better inference from limited observations, making vestige-based monitoring a more viable alternative for large-scale ecological studies. Finally, I will highlight the importance of adding a third dimension (plant biomass) to traditional wildlife monitoring programmes, which may be estimated remotely, reducing even further the costs of establishing a potential wildlife monitoring protocol.
