I obtained my PhD in Statistics from National University of Ireland, Galway after I had finished my Bachelor and Master degree in Statistics at the University of Tehran, Iran. Following my PhD, I joined the prostate cancer research group in UCD Conway Institute as a postdoctoral research fellow and worked on accurate grading and staging of prostate cancer. I am currently Lecturer in Statistics & Data Science in University of Limerick. My research interests include Survival analysis, Bayesian approach and Machine learning, in particular, their application in cancer research.

I graduated with first-class honours BSc in Biological Sciences from the University of São Paulo. Since starting my undergraduate degree, I have participated in several statistics, mathematical modelling, and machine learning projects. Thanks to these opportunities, I love being involved in multidisciplinary projects focusing on ecological and entomological research. I am a PhD researcher in Statistical Ecology at the Hamilton Institute of Maynooth University, funded by Science Foundation Ireland’s Centre for Research Training in Foundations of Data Science programme. My PhD project is “Statistical Modelling and machine learning applied to automating animal monitoring systems”. See my personal [webpage](https://gabrielrpalma.com).

I am Kate Finucane, a PhD researcher in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at University College Dublin. My research focuses on missing data imputation techniques using Bayesian methods, with applications to metabolomics. I hold a bachelor's degree in Physics and Astrophysics from Trinity College Dublin and a master's degree in Data and Computational Science from University College Dublin. I am also very passionate about scientific communication - I believe the public should be able to learn about the science they are funding! I am currently a producer of the Pint of Science Ireland podcast and have been involved in other podcasts, productions, and events in the past.

I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, University of Galway. My research focuses on longitudinal data analysis. I am working on HealIntel Project, With a focus on longitudinal functional data analysis. I finished a postdoc role on Statistical Learning, with a focus on Neural Networks, at the University of Limerick, Ireland on September 30, 2023. Before starting my first post doc , I was a Lecturer in Statistics, at Shahid Beheshti University. I have over 10 years of experience in research and lecturing a diverse array of statistical content. I finished my PhD and MSc degree, respectively, in Statistics and Mathematical Statistics, from Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran. I have worked on the longitudinal mixed data, and extended the inflated and mixture models for count, continuous, and ordinal correlated responses.

Hi! My name is Silvia and I am a lecturer in the School of Computer Science and Statistics, Trinity College Dublin. My research involves developing novel statistical methodology for various types of multidimensional data. I quite enjoy working on data-related problems and over the years I have had experience with many different types of data, such as social networks, metabolomic or genomic data. Outside of Statistics, I am a hiking and tag rugby enthusiast and enjoy every sort of outdoor activity. See my personal [webpage](https://silviadangelo.github.io/).

I am a lecturer in Applied Statistics at the Technological University of the Shannon, and a PhD researcher in Statistics at the University of Limerick. I hold a BEng in Automation & Control Technology (LIT), BSc in Electronic Systems (LIT), HDipAppSc in Applied Mathematics (NUIG) and a MSc in Mathematical Modelling (UL). Having worked in the automotive, manufacturing, and aerospace industries, I’m particularly interested in industrial/engineering applications. My main research interests are reliability analysis, statistical process control, experimental design and accelerated life testing. In addition to statistics, I have a keen interest in motorcycles (and just about anything with a four-stroke petrol engine).
